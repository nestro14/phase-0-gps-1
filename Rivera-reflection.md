**Here are my answers!**

```What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with branches and merging. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git push and pull requests were clarified better for me. I definitely feel more confident using those actions now!

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked Nestor about specific bash commands that he was well versed in.
We asked our guide about git fetch and git pull.

What still confuses you about Git?
git push origin master confuses me a bit. I get confused on origin and master names that are given. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was so exciting! I really enjoyed working with Nestor and Celeen. Nestor was very receptive to directives while I was the navigator and always gave me precise and positive directions/feedback when I was driving. Nestor was also incredibly patient during an intense VIM lockdown. We both did independent research on stack overflow whenever one of us was stuck. Overall, an incredible experience!```
